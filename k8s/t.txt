But how those nodes actually communicate  

with the Charles or and how are they managed. 
In a Kubernetes cluster there was master node  

and other nodes in the cluster are called worker 
nodes. and master node actually manages worker  

nodes. And if Master nodes job to distribute 
for example, load across other worker nodes  

and all boards, which are related to your 
applications are deployed on worker nodes,  

master node runs only system ports, 
which are responsible for actual  

work of the Kubernetes cluster in general, 
we could also say that master node in the  

Kubernetes cluster is actually control plane, 
and it does not run your client applications.  




Cube proxy which is present on each node as 
well is responsible for network communication  

inside of each node and between nodes. Also, 
there are other services which are present  

on master node. And they are scheduler and 
such service is responsible for planning  

and distribution of the Lord between 
different nodes in the classroom.  


the Kubernetes cluster. And it controls actually 
what happens on each of the nodes in the cluster.  

Also, there was cloud controller manager. And his 
job is interaction with cloud service provider  


DNS  

service which is responsible for names resolution, 
entire Kubernetes cluster. And for instance,  

using a DNS service, you could connect to specific 
deployment by the name of the corresponding  

deployment service. And in such way, you could 
connect different deployments with a job or
